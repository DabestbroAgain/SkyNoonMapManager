# SkyNoonMapManager
Modding tool for Sky Noon that autogenerates .pak files to add modded maps to the in-game map selector.

# Client Usage
1. Download the latest release of SkyNoonMapManager from the releases tab.
2. Find your Sky Noon installation folder. On Steam, right click Sky Noon > Properties > Installed Files > Browse
3. Navigate to your .paks folder. From the installation folder, go SkyNoon > Content > Paks
4. Drop the SkyNoonMapManager zip folder into the Paks folder. Extract it, then move the executables/dlls from the extracted folder to the base of the paks folder.

SkyNoonMapManager is now ready for usage. Any time you install a new map mod, double click on SNMapManager.exe and it will generate an updated .pak file with a patched map selector.
If you have issues/errors, SNMapManager will output helpful info to the command line which you can send to me with a github issue.
